This file is for internal organization. I figure that I might aswell post it to the github repo since It will probably represent a fair bit of my working out. The more important information on this document should find itself into the README later.


===============================================
 The process (includes some worries and stuff)
===============================================

data collection
   given directory, read all of weather files into one table
      # This uses a python for loop, but only for about 20 values. shouldn't matter
      # header=14 is used as param to indicate start of data. Might want to do this dynamically instead of with a magic number
   given directory, read all of picture files into one table
      # This uses a python for loop, with about 5000 values. TODO take a look into this, it might be a good spot for optimization.
      # Add filename to each entry as well, since it contains date information
      # Data is given with 2 columns, first is base filename, second is an array of [r,g,b] triples
      # STUB At some point the filename should be split into time, or year/month/day/hour (helper method)
      # STUB At some point the [r,g,b] should be unpacked into labelled columns, to be each a feature (helper method?)





===================================================================
 The plan (mostly outlines what I (originally) think I need to do)
===================================================================

~roughly

My goal/task:
(1) Describe the weather from pictures.
i)   pair the data together
ii)  transform and clean the data
iii) manipulate features
iv)  choose some appropriate models
v)   train and test models, make comparisons

(2) Write a report
- approximately 2 pages
- cater to technically literate without using heavy jargon
* steps taken from project outline
i)   The problem you are addressing, particularly how you refined the provided idea.
ii)  The data that you used: how it was gathered, cleaned, etc.
iii) Techniques you used to analyse the data.
iv)  Your results/findings/conclusions.
v)   Some appropriate visualization of your data/results.
vi)  Limitations: problems you encountered, things you would do if you had more time, things you should have done in retrospect, etc.

Available Data:
Weather-data
- Date (Year, Month, Day, Time)
- Data Quality
- Temp (and for Dew Point)
- Humidity
- Wind (Dir, Spd)
- Visibility
- Pressure
- Weather (Rain, Cloudy, Mostly Cloudy, NA, Clear, Mainly Clear, Rain Showers, Fog, Drizzle)
Katkam-images
- 5046 images
- 256*192

Problems:
to be determined
I think the biggest difficulty will be to get a good set of image features

Ideas:
use PCA to automatically reduce features
lower resolution to reduce features.
add some features (overall brightness, overall hue)

Reminders!
add ggbaker, yajiez as developers
