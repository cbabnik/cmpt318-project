This file is for internal organization. I figure that I might aswell post it to the github repo since It will probably represent a fair bit of my working out. The more important information on this document should find itself into the README later.


~roughly

My goal/task:
(1) Describe the weather from pictures.
i)   pair the data together
ii)  transform and clean the data
iii) manipulate features
iv)  choose some appropriate models
v)   train and test models, make comparisons

(2) Write a report
- approximately 2 pages
- cater to technically literate without using heavy jargon
* steps taken from project outline
i)   The problem you are addressing, particularly how you refined the provided idea.
ii)  The data that you used: how it was gathered, cleaned, etc.
iii) Techniques you used to analyse the data.
iv)  Your results/findings/conclusions.
v)   Some appropriate visualization of your data/results.
vi)  Limitations: problems you encountered, things you would do if you had more time, things you should have done in retrospect, etc.

Available Data:
Weather-data
- Date (Year, Month, Day, Time)
- Data Quality
- Temp (and for Dew Point)
- Humidity
- Wind (Dir, Spd)
- Visibility
- Pressure
- Weather (Rain, Cloudy, Mostly Cloudy, NA, Clear, Mainly Clear, Rain Showers, Fog, Drizzle)
Katkam-images
- 5046 images
- 256*192

Problems:
to be determined
I think the biggest difficulty will be to get a good set of image features

Ideas:
use PCA to automatically reduce features
lower resolution to reduce features.
add some features (overall brightness, overall hue)

Reminders!
add ggbaker, yajiez as developers
