This file is kind of a notes extension. I made it for my own reference, but it includes some working out and
organization. So I thought I might as well put it on GitHub aswell.

(values taken from all weather data)

interesting results from above.
Clear, Cloudy, Mostly Clear, Moderately Cloudy, are mutually exclusive to rain descriptions.
So I can expect those to be descriptions of no rain.

Summary, we get two main tables
(1) sky
   [757] Rain
   [80]  Snow
   [470]  Very Cloudy
   [770] Somewhat Cloudy
   [131]  Clear
(2) fog
   [97]  Fog
   [2111] No Fog
(values taken just from image matched weather data, what i am using)

note that getting a 90%+ score for Fog is trivial.
my focus is on the "sky" table, i'll challenge fog if I have time
